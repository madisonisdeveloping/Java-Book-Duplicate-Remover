# Java-Book-Duplicate-Remover
A Java program designed to remove duplicate book titles from an input file selected by the user, using a file chooser dialog. It then writes the unique titles to an output file chosen by the user. Duplicate detection triggers a custom exception that displays a message with the duplicate title's name.
